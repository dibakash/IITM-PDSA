# Analysis of Algorithms

## What are we interested in when we are computing the performance of an Algorithm?

---

### Two main resources of Interest:

- Running time - how much time the Algorithm takes
- Space - memory requirements

### Time depends of Processing Power -

- Impossible to change for a given hardware
- Based on the present computing power of the CPUs ( last 10 / 15 years (this is 2022) ), Python can do around 10<sup>7</sup> operations/ second.
- Enhancing hardware has only a limited impact at a practical level
- Meaning, even if we upgrade to a machine which is 10 times faster would not have any significant impact on something which is inherently long to compute.

### Storage is limited by Available Memory

- Easier to configure, augment


Because of this reason, when we talk about performance the focus is more on time rather than space aspect of performance
