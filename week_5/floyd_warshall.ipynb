    "The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. Some important points and properties of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All-pairs shortest path**: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Negative cycles**: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can detect negative cycles in the graph. A negative cycle is a cycle in the graph where the sum of the weights of the edges is negative. If there is a negative cycle in the graph, then the algorithm will report that there is a negative cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic programming**: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses dynamic programming to compute the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph. The algorithm builds a table of shortest paths between pairs of nodes by iteratively considering intermediate nodes along the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No guarantee of uniqueness**: The shortest path between two nodes in a graph may not be unique. If there are multiple shortest paths between two nodes, then the Floyd-Warshall algorithm may return any one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Floyd-Warshall's works for both directed and undirected graphs with non-negative edges weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Floyd-Warshall's does not work with an undirected graph with negative edges weight, as it will be declared as a negative weight cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps for the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization: Create a 2-dimensional array SP of size n x n, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. For each pair of vertices (i,j), initialize SP[i][j] to the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge between vertices i and j, then set SP[i][j] to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each vertex k from 1 to n, compute the shortest path between every pair of vertices (i,j) that passes through k. To do this, update SP[i][j] as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $SP[i][j] = min(SP[i][j], SP[i][k] + SP[k][j])$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This means that the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j that passes through k is the minimum of the current shortest path from i to j and the sum of the shortest path from i to k and the shortest path from k to j.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the step 2 is complete, the SP array will contain the shortest path between every pair of vertices in the graph."
