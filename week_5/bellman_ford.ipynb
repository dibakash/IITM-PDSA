    "Bellman-Ford algorithm is a dynamic programming based algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph, where the edge weights may be negative. Here are some important points and properties of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **It can handle graphs with negative edge weights**: Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, which can only handle non-negative edge weights, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle graphs with negative edge weights. However, it cannot handle graphs with negative cycles, which are cycles that have a negative sum of edge weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **It can detect negative cycles**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm can detect negative cycles in a graph. If there is a negative cycle, the algorithm will report that there is no shortest path from the source vertex to some other vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **It can handle disconnected graphs**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle disconnected graphs by finding the shortest paths from the source vertex to all other vertices in each connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **It uses dynamic programming**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm uses dynamic programming to solve the shortest path problem. It maintains an array of distances that is gradually updated until it converges to the correct values.\n",
    "Bellman-Ford works for both directed and undirected graphs with non-negative edges weights.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-step instructions for the Bellman-Ford algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the distance array: Set the distance of the source vertex to 0 and the distances of all other vertices to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relax all edges: Repeat the following step (V-1) times, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. For each edge (u,v) with weight w, if the distance to u plus w is less than the distance to v, update the distance to v to the distance to u plus w.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check for negative weight cycles: After relaxing all edges V-1 times, check for negative weight cycles. For each edge (u,v) with weight w, if the distance to u plus w is less than the distance to v, there exists a negative weight cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print the distance array: If there are no negative weight cycles, print the distance array, which contains the shortest path distances from the source vertex to all other vertices."
