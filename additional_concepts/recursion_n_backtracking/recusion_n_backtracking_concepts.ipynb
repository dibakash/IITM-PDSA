It can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems, each of which is a smaller version of the original problem. The base case is the smallest subproblem that can be solved directly.\n",

The base case corresponds to the initial value in the mathematical induction proof, and the inductive step corresponds to the recursive call.

The base case in a recursive function corresponds to the initial value in a mathematical induction proof, and the recursive call corresponds to the inductive step. By ensuring that the base case is correct and the recursive call eventually reaches the base case, we can use recursion to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems."
